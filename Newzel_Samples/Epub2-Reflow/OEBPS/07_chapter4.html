<p class="noindent"><i>Anaesthetists are central to ensuring the safety of patients in the peri-operative period.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Operating sessions must be planned to allow time for the anaesthetist responsible for an individual&#8217;s care to visit him/ her pre-operatively. This should take place before arrival in the anaesthetic room in all but exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is the responsibility of the individual anaesthetist giving the anaesthetic to ensure that the pre-operative assessment is adequate and that the patient has sufficient information to make a reasoned decision. It is the responsibility of the Trust to ensure that sufficient time is made available for this, as a matter of routine and without undue pressure. Pre-operative anaesthetic assessment is an integral part of the surgical process, and must be included in the estimates of time required for the operating list.</p>
<p class="noindent">The pre-operative assessment process should have identified and addressed problems with individual patients, and provided the patient with appropriate information on the probable peri-operative course. This should allow the pre-operative visit to focus on the individual patient&#8217;s needs and concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a part of the pre-operative visit the anaesthetist should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a rapport with the patient and when relevant the patient&#8217;s family.</li>
<li>Determine the adequacy of pre-operative assessment and preparation, including arrangements for intra-operative and postoperative care.</li>
<li>Confirm the plan and discuss anaesthetic and postoperative care, including premedication, mode of anaesthesia, analgesia and anti-emetics.</li>
<li><a id="page_16"/>Ensure the patient is aware of any risks particular to that patient or associated with specific anaesthetic procedures.</li>
<li>Ensure the patient understands the nature of the operation and is happy to proceed (N.B. see footnote on page 7).</li>
<li>Confirm the availability of HDU or intensive care unit beds if appropriate, before proceeding.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Anaesthetists in training and non-consultant grades should discuss high-risk patients with consultant colleagues. The consultant contacted should ensure that the patient is cared for by an anaesthetist with the expertise required for that particular situation. Failure of the pre-operative service to match personnel to the need of the patient may result in surgery being postponed until the necessary expertise is available.</p>
<p class="noindent">Cancellations have a negative impact on patients, families and clinical services. Where possible, department protocols should be adhered to and cancellations for idiosyncratic reasons discouraged.</p>
<p class="noindent">Occasionally, anaesthetists will cancel surgery in patients who have been assessed and prepared by another senior anaesthetist. Anaesthetists should alert their colleagues if there is a failure in following protocol or when the protocol has been ineffective. Differences of opinion should be discussed within a department with the aim of avoiding future cancellations, and protocols modified accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent">If surgery is cancelled the anaesthetist should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the reasons for cancellation and ensure that the patient and his/her family understand what will happen next.</li>
<li>Explain the cancellation to the surgical and pre-operative assessment teams, and primary care where appropriate. Clearly document the reason for cancellation and any<a id="page_17"/> recommendations for optimisation in the patient&#8217;s medical notes.</li>
<li>Take steps to allow surgery to proceed safely at a future date.</li>
<li>Address deficiencies in the system to reduce the number of late cancellations.</li>
</ul>
