<p class="noindent"><i>Routine pre-operative investigations are expensive, labour-intensive and of questionable value, especially as they may contribute to morbidity or cause additional delays due to spurious results.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The National Institute of Healthcare and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends the following pre-operative tests (surgical severity scores are given in Appendix 3) [19]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrocardiography: if older than 80; if older than 60 and surgical severity at &#8805; 3; any cardiovascular disease; severe renal disease.</li>
<li>Full blood count: if older than 60 <b>and</b> surgical severity &#8805; grade 2; all adults if surgical severity &#8805; grade 3; severe renal disease.</li>
<li>Urea, electrolytes and creatinine: if older than 60 and surgical severity &#8805; grade 3; all adults if surgical severity grade 4; any renal disease; severe cardiovascular disease.</li>
<li>Pregnancy test for women who may be pregnant. Sickle-cell test on families with homozygous disease or heterozygous trait; ancestry that is African, Afro-Caribbean, Asian, Middle-Eastern, east-Mediterranean.</li>
<li>Chest X-ray: patients scheduled for critical care.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">History and examination performed by appropriately trained and competent personnel remains the most efficient and accurate way of initially detecting significant morbidity. There is recent evidence that patients of any age with no major comorbidities (ASA physical status 1 or 2 - see Appendix 4) presenting for day surgery do not need pre-operative investigations [20].</p>
<p class="noindent">Local departmental protocols should determine which additional tests should be used based upon patient age,<a id="page_23"/> comorbidity and complexity of the surgery.</p>
<p class="noindent">Anaemia ( &#60; 12 g.dl<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for women and &#60; 13 g.dl<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for men should be investigated and treated before planned surgery, using haematinics such as oral/intravenous iron rather than transfusion. The urgency and nature of surgery, plus patient-specific factors, will determine the balance between reversing anaemia and proceding with surgery. The aim, to avoid peri-operative blood transfusion, is best achieved when hospital pre-operative services work with other departments and primary care.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluation of high-risk patients should estimate cardiovascular risk according to the severity of systemic disease (see Appendix 5), functional capacity and the grade of the planned surgery [21].</p>
<p class="noindent">Tests of functional capacity include exercise ECG, CPX testing and myocardial perfusion scans.</p>
