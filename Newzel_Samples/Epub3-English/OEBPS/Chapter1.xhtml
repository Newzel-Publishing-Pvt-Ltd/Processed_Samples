<p class="Text">This book is concerned with human resource management (HRM) and the ways in which organizations manage their employees. This chapter will outline the various meanings of HRM, showing that it can refer to a specific functional role carried out by specialist staff as well as being a particular approach to people management. However, many companies do not have a specialist HRM department and line managers are given responsibility for carrying out people management activities. This means that the term &#x2018;HRM&#x2019; can be wide-ranging in terms of what it involves, who undertakes it, and what it actually means. <a href="#ch1h1_2">Section 1.2</a> highlights some of the activities that the human resources (HR) function carries out, and illustrates the contingent nature of their enactment. Although all organizations engage in certain people management activities, the ways in which they do so will depend significantly on factors such as the organization&#x2019;s size, the nature of the company&#x2019;s business, and the accepted professional and organizational norms as to how this work should be done. <a href="#ch1h1_3">Section 1.3</a> explores the &#x2018;promise&#x2019; of HRM, looking at what HRM as a set of ideas and associated practices pledged to organizations that adopted them, with <a href="#ch1h1_4">Section 1.4</a> focusing on three aspects of contemporary HRM and how these connect to the &#x2018;bargain&#x2019; HRM offers organizations. The context of this &#x2018;bargain&#x2019; is explored in <a href="#ch1h1_5">Section 1.5</a>, placing attempts to secure high-performance/high-commitment &#x2018;high-road&#x2019; HRM practices within a broader economic context. What these developments mean for the HR function, and what the future might hold for HRM, is explored in <a href="#ch1h1_6">Sections 1.6</a> and <a href="#ch1h1_7">1.7</a>.</p>
<p class="H1_Level1"><a id="ch1h1_2">1.2 HRM in practice</a></p>
<p class="Text">There is no one accepted view as to what HRM is. This book uses a loose definition of HRM which includes the policies and practices used to organize work and employ people; it encompasses the management of work and the management of people to do the work (Boxall and Purcell 2011: 3). It is also used in a narrower way to denote a distinctive approach to people management in both theoretical and practitioner terms. Other meanings used within this book will use the phrase &#x2018;human resources&#x2019; to refer to the company&#x2019;s employees, and are one element of resource available to organizations, sitting alongside financial and other assets that facilitate the attainment of business goals. Finally, the expression can also refer to the Human Resources (HR) function or department that is tasked by many, often larger companies, with achieving effective people management.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_2_1"><span class="greentxt">1.2.1</span> The Tmain HRM activities</p>
<p class="Text">It is virtually impossible to grow an organization without employing people, and HRM is a process that accompanies the expansion of organizations and as such can be seen as a correlate of entrepreneurial success and organizational growth (Boxall and Purcell 2011). HRM involves a wide range of activities, and responsibility for their enactment often lies with a range of staff within an organization. As such, it is rarely the <i>sole</i> responsibility of a dedicated department&#x2014;meaning that the function (where it exists) does not always have control over its own domain. This can have unwelcome ramifications even though the devolution of day-to-day responsibility can allow HR staff to do more strategic, as opposed to operational, work. For those companies without a specialist function, HRM is usually the responsibility of line or functional managers.</p>
<p class="TextInd">The most common HRM activities involve a cycle of interrelated tasks starting with those actions concerned with assessing organizational needs for staff. This can involve determining whether such needs can be resourced internally, or whether the company needs to attract staff from the external labour market. But whilst all organizations engage in recruitment and selection of employees, the ways this activity will be carried out will be highly contingent on and depend on the resources available for this activity, such as staff expertise, time and money, the nature of the post, the size of the organization, and the company&#x2019;s business. These are highlighted in <a href="#box1_1">Box 1.1</a>; the issues involved with recruitment and selection are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. The DVD interview with Pam Bader provides insights as to the challenges faced by a small HRM team working in a franchising operation and shed light on the issues outlined below.</p>
<div class="blueBox">
<p class="blueBox_head" id="box1_1"><a id="page_5"></a><img class="frame_1" src="images/par.gif" alt="image" /> Box 1.1 Window on work<br/><span class="blueBox_head1">Recruiting for staff</span></p>
<p class="Text1">These organizations all need to expand their staff, but this will take different forms and have different challenges given the nature of the business&#x2014;as these three illustrations suggest.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is taking on more than 1000 production staff at a plant in the West Midlands, thus increasing the workforce at the Solihull plant by more than 25 per cent. Emerging markets such as China and India have been key to its success, which has also seen the organization recruit 1000 engineers. Whilst the market for cars in Europe is weak, markets like Russia, China, and India are keen to purchase &#x2018;trophy brand&#x2019; cars like Jaguar and Land Rover (BBC News Online 2011<i>a</i>). Within seven days of the announcement, the organization had received 8000 applications for the 1000 jobs (Peacock 2011).</p>
<p class="TextInd">Since the launch of the UK government&#x2019;s &#x2018;East London Tech City&#x2019; initiative, Silicon Roundabout&#x2019;s profile has expanded considerably, and the Shoreditch area of London is now seeing an influx of entrepreneurs and technology companies. Most arrivals are small business start-ups who are attracted by the lower rents and shorter-term office leases available in the city (Bradshaw 2011). Recruitment company, Silicon Milkroundabout (<a href="http://www.siliconroundabout.org.uk">www.siliconroundabout.org.uk</a>), is concerned with attracting potential recruits from graduates through to senior level developers to opportunities in the tech sector which they might be unaware of because of the advertising spend made by big corporations when recruiting dwarfs that of the start-ups. More than 100 companies attend the regular Silicon Milkroundabout with an average of 500 jobs being on offer at each event (Solon 2011).</p>
<p class="TextInd">When the Glastonbury Festival is in full flow, it is akin to being in a huge tented city with distinct socio-geographic regions scattered across the site. Although 250,000 revellers will join the festival each year, very few people are directly employed by the festival itself. However, the festival requires large numbers of people to do various jobs in order for the event to take place. Specialist jobs such as stage hands, crew, and lighting technicians are handled by relevant companies who provide services to Glastonbury. However, there are opportunities to work for a ticket via other, less specialist, organizations who also provide volunteers to carry out a range of jobs such as gate stewards, tent stewards, and wardens (<a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk">www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk</a> <a href="http://www.glastowatch.co.uk">www.glastowatch.co.uk</a>).</p>
</div>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_2_2"><span class="greentxt">1.2.2</span> Achieving performance</p>
<p class="Text">Another focus of HR activity is that of achieving high performance by developing the skills and knowledge of staff, and aligning them to the needs of the organization. These development and training activities are outlined in more detail in Chapter 6. Assessing these needs often depends on data gathered from performance management systems, but the policies and procedures used by HR here will depend on a variety of organizational variables and will be explored in Chapter 11. However, the case illustration in <a href="#box1_2">Box 1.2</a> gives an insight into to how organizations can put this into practice.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_2_3"><span class="greentxt">1.2.3</span> Rewarding employees</p>
<p class="Text">One of the more challenging aspects of HR work involves pay and determining how staff will be rewarded. People are increasingly being paid in very flexible ways, and in many companies individuals can be employed and remunerated on varying bases. The differing bases on which people are paid and rewarded will often depend on the nature of the job they perform, what the organization can afford, and what each occupational group is worth in the wider employment market. They can also be based on the skills, knowledge, and experience individuals bring to a company, and the ways in which their contribution adds value to it. Some companies offer choices concerning their pay and benefits package, which reflects an acknowledgement that staff have diverse needs. These issues are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, but <a href="#box1_3">Box 1.3</a> highlights some familiar areas of controversy seen with regard to executive pay.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_2_4"><span class="greentxt">1.2.4</span> Locating the organization</p>
<p class="Text">Finally, organizations and the HR function need to consider where the company will be based. Whilst some organizations have decided to relocate their entire business overseas to take &#x00AD;advantage of lower operating costs in developing economies, others have been more selective as to what functions are offshored in this way (as is seen in <a href="#box1_4">Box 1.4</a>). In addition, technological developments have had a profound impact on the ways in which work can be carried out, with greater use of home working, tele-working, and virtual working. All these decisions will have implications for people management. The increasingly international dimension of HRM and its staffing implications will be explored in Chapter 15.</p>

<p class="Text1">Infosys is one of the fastest growing and most successful IT services companies in the world (<a href="http://www.infosys.com">www.infosys.com</a>). The aim of the company is to become a provider of business solutions leveraging technology to compete with any consultancy in the world. This goal is built upon the vast talent pool available in India where the company is based, but it also depends on their commitment to maintain, enhance, and update skills at every level. Infosys uses a competency system to determine required skills and knowledge, and every individual must have a competency development plan, based on these competencies, which takes account of individual performance, organizational priorities and, where appropriate, client feedback.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Training interventions are organized in four key areas:</p>
<ul class="BList1">
<li><span class="vidot">&#x2022;</span><span class="BLB-7 char-style-override-31">&#x0009;</span>technology and project management</li>

<li><span class="vidot">&#x2022;</span><span class="BLB-7 char-style-override-31">&#x0009;</span>quality processes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="TextInd">The training department delivers programmes which are usually based away from the job itself and are mainly project specific. In addition, there is an ambitious knowledge management programme in place with rewards and recognition for those staff who submit knowledge ideas which are highly rated by their peers (CIPD 2006<i>d</i>; Anderson 2007).</p>
</div>
<p class="TextInd">Having considered some of the people management issues that all organizations will face as they grow, it is pertinent to explore HRM within the next two sections as a distinctive approach to the management of people, and then place the development of these ideas against a wider socio-economic context in <a href="#ch1h1_6">Section 1.6</a>.</p>

<p class="Text2">For several years, concern has been expressed over the degree of remuneration received by senior figures in the financial services industry, leading, for example, to major pension funds urging a radical overhaul of boardroom pay in an effort to curb or end the payouts which have been the subject of public discontent and negative publicity (Treanor 2012<i>a</i>). However, Richard Pym, Chairman of UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), the operation that oversees Bradford and Bingley and the &#x2018;bad&#x2019; banking arm of Northern Rock, decided to take a 5 per cent cut to his &#x00A3;250,000 fees. In his statement in the annual report Pym said: &#x2018;We are very conscious that we currently owe HM Treasury directly and indirectly &#x00A3;46.6bn and it is our expectation and our determination to repay that debt in full without loss to the taxpayer&#x2019; (Treanor 2012<i>b</i>). The bank admits that they have a significant number of customers who are finding it difficult to meet their repayments, making 37,000 &#x2018;mortgage and account modifications&#x2019; to help those in trouble with repayments (Treanor 2012<i>b</i>).</p>

<p class="orangeBox_head" id="box1_4"><a id="page_7"></a><span><img class="frame_1" src="images/clock.gif" alt="image" /></span><span class="space1"></span>Box 1.4 International focus<br/><span class="blueviBox_head1">The implications of offshoring and the rise of rural sourcing</span></p>
<p class="Text3">The practice of &#x2018;offshoring&#x2019; generally involves transfer of business functions and associated jobs from one country to another. Whilst the main rationale for offshoring is usually to achieve cost savings through the migration of jobs from higher- to lower-waged economies, it can also occur for strategic reasons. These include entering new markets to tap talent that is currently unavailable domestically or to overcome regulations that restrict business activity. The bulk of offshored activities include call centres, software development, human resource management administration, and payroll processing. Increasingly, higher value-added jobs are being offshored, such as complex financial analysis, technology R&#x0026;D, and innovation. The major providers of offshore services are China, India, Ireland, Israel, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, and South Africa, with India accounting for the largest share of offshored jobs, mainly in IT and IT-enabled services.</p>
<p class="TextInd">However, offshoring has often generated negative publicity for organizations that shift jobs overseas. One option to offshoring is rural sourcing&#x2014;having work done in domestic locations where salaries and operating expenses are lower (e.g. the Midwest of the USA). This allows companies to use the skills of professionals who choose to live in rural areas and reduces the costs to companies seeking their services because those living in rural areas generally have a lower cost of living. This means that companies can keep their projects in their host country and still reduce their overall spending. It also provides advantages in terms of the general absence of a language barrier and the relatively similar time zones&#x2014;as opposed to most offshoring operations. For the workers, professionals who choose to live in rural communities for personal reasons are often willing to accept lower salaries than those obtainable in cities.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Whether a company opts to offshore or rural source, there will be HR implications associated with each option. What might they be and how might they differ?</p>
</div>
<p class="H1_Level1"><a id="ch1h1_3">1.3 The &#x2018;promise&#x2019; of HRM</a></p>
<p class="Text">The term &#x2018;human resource management&#x2019; originated in the USA in the early 1980s and offers the promise that the people management function, where it exists, can not only meet the challenges faced by contemporary organizations, such as heightened competitive pressures, industrial restructuring, and changes in the nature of work, but can also embody a heightened strategic role if its philosophies and practices are used coherently (Guest 1987; Storey 1992, 2001). Proponents argue that the HR function needs to design, implement, and manage a range of integrated and sophisticated people management techniques concerned with enhancing worker skills and commitment, with these techniques being aligned to the organization&#x2019;s strategic business goals. The emphasis placed upon establishing a secure fit between employment policies and practices and the organization&#x2019;s business objectives continues to be one of the main ways in which HRM asserts its approach towards people management, seeing long-term competitive advantage lying in the alignment between corporate goals, HRM strategy, and HRM activities (e.g. Fombrun, Tichy, and Devanna 1984; Huselid 1995). This will be explored in more detail in Chapter 2.</p>
<p class="TextInd">This has also been accompanied by the HR profession placing considerable emphasis on organizational culture and values (Deal and Kennedy 1982; Peters and Waterman 1982) in order to enhance employee commitment and discretionary effort: i.e. &#x2018;going the extra mile&#x2019; for the organization; putting in additional effort if sufficiently motivated and conscientious. It involves placing an emphasis on creating the conditions for employees to act on their own initiative and to take more responsibility for their work and workplace behaviour (Wood and Albanese 1995: 216). It is also associated with increased employee autonomy and functional flexibility which are achieved through teamworking, direct communication from management to employees, reduction in hierarchical organizational structures through the removal of tiers of middle management (often referred to as &#x2018;delayering&#x2019;), and an investment in staff through recruitment, job security, and career development. In this way, employees are viewed as being more likely to exert discretionary effort based on an internal desire to do so, rather than because sanctions would be forthcoming or from any other form of external pressure (Guest 1987; Purcell et&#x00A0;al. 2003).</p>
<p class="TextInd"><a id="page_8"></a>If the propositions listed above are combined, then organizational effectiveness should be enhanced, leading to employees being able to respond to unanticipated pressures, to be adaptable, and to move freely between tasks. Thompson (2003) argues that these ideas were underpinned by an assumption that a &#x2018;bargain&#x2019; of sorts was in operation. This was based on the notion that cohesiveness and reciprocity existed between strategic (i.e. an organization&#x2019;s senior management/board), functional/departmental, and workplace levels&#x2014;that in return for workers engaging with expanded job responsibilities, employers will make investments in staff training, improved career structures, job stability, and performance and skill-based reward measures (Appelbaum et&#x00A0;al. 2000). The extent to which this bargain has been implemented will be explored in <a href="#ch1h1_6">Sections 1.6</a> and <a href="#ch1h1_7">1.7</a>.</p>
<p class="TextInd">However, these &#x2018;soft&#x2019;/high-road/high-performance work systems (see <a href="#box1_5">Box 1.5</a>) are not always appropriate for all organizations or in all circumstances, although some have argued differently (Pfeffer 1994). They have also been juxtaposed with markedly different approaches towards attaining this strategic fit between the goals of the business and HR approaches and activities (often referred to as &#x2018;hard&#x2019; or &#x2018;low-road&#x2019; HRM).</p>

<p class="Text3">Individually, or in small groups, place yourself in the role of an HR professional. Think of organizations where it would be appropriate to use &#x2018;hard&#x2019; and &#x2018;soft&#x2019; HRM approaches. What kind of organizations are they and are there any similarities between them? If so, what are they? What kinds of HRM approaches towards pay, worker representation, training, and general management would be appropriate in which context and why?</p>
</div>
<p class="TextInd">Given these different approaches, it is useful to contemplate how and where they might be used&#x2014;and in what business circumstances. <a href="#box1_6">Box 1.6</a> offers the opportunity to discuss their use.</p>

<ul class="BList1">
<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> The nature of people management is highly contingent and its practice will be strongly dependent on a variety of variables that are under the organization&#x2019;s control, but many are not.</li>
<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> From its inception, the distinctiveness of HRM lay in its emphasis on the fit between people management policies and practices and the organization&#x2019;s business strategy.

<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> The strategy&#x2013;performance relationship is arguably central to the ways in which HRM is understood both as a concept and as involving a range of practices designed to achieve business goals.

</ul>
<p class="Text">Guest (1987) and Storey (2001) provide accounts of the ideas outlined in this section. As a counterbalance, it is instructive to read Keenoy (1990), Legge (1995), and P. Thompson (2003, 2011). They critique many of the underpinning assumptions outlined and expose the contradictions they contain.</p>
<p class="H1_Level1"><a id="ch1h1_4">1.4 Contemporary HRM debates: human capital, talent management, and employee&#x00A0;engagement</a></p>
<p class="Text">Three themes which are based on the promise of HRM outlined previously have emerged as being of importance to the contemporary practitioner: the need for organizations to be able to recruit and retain key people&#x2014;often referred to as &#x2018;talent management&#x2019; (this is explored in more detail in Chapters 5 and 8); employee engagement (the combination of commitment to the organization and its values as well as a willingness to assist colleagues (CIPD 2011<i>c</i>); and the centrality of human capital ideas (the knowledge, skills, abilities, and capacity of employees to develop and innovate) (CIPD 2011<i>e</i>). These will be explored and then set against the wider organizational backdrop of developments in the economy over time in <a href="#ch1h1_6">Section 1.6</a>.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_4_1"><span class="greentxt">1.4.1</span> Human capital</p>
<p class="Text">According to the CIPD (2011<i>e</i>), <span>it is now widely accepted that the value of an organization is drawn from a mix of assets. Some are tangible and manifest physically (such as buildings, machinery, and land), whereas other phenomena such as the organization&#x2019;s brand, its reputation, and the people who work for it are intangible but hugely important in an economy which is increasingly argued to be knowledge-based. The idea of human capital is not a new one, and generally debates concerning this issue often distinguish between &#x2018;specific&#x2019; human capital (skills and knowledge that are only useful to a single employer or industry) and &#x2018;general&#x2019; human capital which covers skills and knowledge such as numeracy and literacy which are useful to all firms (Becker 1994).</span></p>

</div>
<p class="TextInd">Soft&#x2019;, &#x2018;commitment&#x2019;, or &#x2018;high-road&#x2019; models of HRM, outlined in <a href="#box1_5">Box 1.5</a>, are based on the idea that labour needs to be treated as an asset to be invested in rather than as a cost&#x2014;or at least where the more valuable core employees are concerned. Within these approaches, which stress the mutuality existing between the employer and the employee, commitment to and investment in human capital activities has been seen as central to competitive advantage (Beer et&#x00A0;al. 1984; Pfeffer 1994; Applebaum et&#x00A0;al. 2000). Running alongside these activities are discourses of commitment and engagement that seek to mobilize discretionary effort with the aim of leveraging the investment made in the human capital of the firm (P. Thompson 2011). The links in Box&#x00A0;1.7 provide some ways of seeing how this might work in practice. It is also useful to watch these clips after having completed the skills activity in <a href="#box1_6">Box 1.6</a> and to assess the parallels that might exist between ideas of human capital and models of HRM.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Alongside ideas of human capital, human capital <i>reporting</i> aims to provide qualitative and quantitative data on a range of measures (such as staff turnover or employee engagement levels) to help identify the kinds of HR and management interventions that are needed to drive business in any given organization. In this way, there is a strong link between the activities of human capital and talent management.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_4_2"><span class="greentxt">1.4.2</span> Talent management</p>
<p class="Text">The concept of talent management is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8; however, it is useful to introduce it here as it has attracted increasing attention from professional bodies, academics, and HR practitioners (Iles et&#x00A0;al. 2010). Talent management is argued to be critical to organizational success, as it is able to give a competitive edge through the identification, development, and (re)deployment of talented employees.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Interest in this concept and associated practices have been argued to stem from the consulting company, McKinsey and their so-called &#x2018;War for Talent&#x2019; reports (e.g. Michaels, Handfield-Jones, and Beth 2001) which argued that the &#x2018;knowledge economy&#x2019; was putting a premium on talent (Preece et&#x00A0;al. 2011). According to the Society of HRM in the USA, talent management demands &#x2018;integrated strategies or systems designed to increase workplace productivity by developing improved processes for attracting, developing, retaining and utilizing people with the required skills and aptitude to meet current and future business needs&#x2019; (Lockwood 2005:1). A joint Chartered Institute of Management/Ashridge study (Blass 2009: 2) sees talent management as &#x2018;the additional management, processes and opportunities that are made available to people in the organization who are considered to be &#x2018;talented&#x2019;, and argues that all organizations manage talent in some way, whether implicitly or explicitly.</p>
<p class="TextInd">However, this can result in narrower or wider approaches towards talent management. Where the narrower deployment of talent management practices is concerned, resources are often allocated to those identified as &#x2018;talented&#x2019; or to posts and post-holders whose jobs are seen as requiring &#x2018;talent&#x2019;. This suggests the acceptance of a &#x2018;differentiated workforce&#x2019; in which talent management is based on targeted rather than generalized investment in human capital, leading to an emphasis on &#x2018;employee of choice&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;employer of choice&#x2019; (Becker et&#x00A0;al. 2009; P. Thompson 2011).</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_4_3"><span class="greentxt">1.4.3</span> Employee engagement</p>
<p class="Text">As stated previously, employers increasingly seek to hire employees who will do their best and exert discretionary effort on the firm&#x2019;s behalf. Employees, it is argued, want jobs that are &#x00AD;worthwhile and satisfying. The idea of employee engagement seems to herald a &#x2018;win&#x2019; for both parties to the employment relationship, and can be seen as a combination of commitment to the &#x00AD;organization and its values that goes beyond job satisfaction and motivation. It is something that the employee has to offer and as such it cannot be required as part of the employment contract (CIPD 2011<i>c</i>).</p>

<p class="Text">In small groups brainstorm the various actions organizations might take to ensure that you are engaged employees. Evaluate this list against your collective and individual work experiences. Which activities did employers engage in to make you feel more engaged? Why do you think that these were more commonly used? To what extent were differential approaches used depending on whether you were a full-time permanent member of staff or employed on a part-time basis? If these differentials existed, what were the outcomes for you and for the organization? If your experiences indicate little effort to secure your engagement and that of your colleagues, how did that make you feel with regard to the organization and the kinds of effort you were willing to exert on its behalf?</p>
</div>
<p class="TextInd">Employers are interested in this concept because engaged employees are argued to have a sense of personal attachment to their work and organization; they are motivated and able to give of their best to help it succeed&#x2014;and from that flows a series of tangible benefits for organization and individual alike (MacLeod and Clarke 2009). This is closely aligned to the promulgation of the concept of the psychological contract, which is based on the belief that when employers deliver on their commitments and fulfil employee expectations they reinforce the employee&#x2019;s sense of fairness and trust in the organization, and generate a positive psychological relationship between employer and employee (CIPD 2011<i>c</i>).</p>
<p class="TextInd">The role of the line manager here is critical to securing and sustaining this engagement (Purcell et&#x00A0;al. 2003) because employees have choices and can decide what level of engagement to offer the employer. Line managers are crucial to ensuring that engagement occurs. Additionally, employees are aware of the employer&#x2019;s &#x2018;brand&#x2019;. Engaged employees are alleged to be more protective of it and to enhance it through providing good service and productivity. In turn, a good employer brand is now seen as key to attracting and retaining employees; this will be explored further in Chapter 5, but <a href="#box1_8">Box 1.8</a> gives the opportunity to reflect on employee engagement in more detail.</p>
<p class="TextInd">However, Coats (2010) calls into question the extent to which employee engagement is witnessed in UK workplaces, seeing it as a failure of what he terms &#x2018;enlightened HRM&#x2019;&#x2014;the combination of employee engagement, high-commitment management, and high-performance work systems. Citing the CIPD&#x2019;s own research (CIPD 2006<i>d</i>), he highlights key findings: the low level of feedback received by employees from their managers and the lack of proper information as to what is happening in their organization, the lack of trust in senior managers, and that in fact employees are unlikely to be &#x2018;engaged&#x2019; in the sense that their aspirations are aligned with the goals of the business.</p>
<p class="TextInd">If we draw together these three contemporary approaches towards HRM, it is possible to argue that they are mutually reinforcing and are based on shared ideas concerning effective people management, focusing on what are termed &#x2018;high-road&#x2019; HRM practices designed to instigate the discretionary effort that occurs when employees identify with the aims and values of the organization. However, these ideas and attendant practices do not exist in a vacuum and need to be placed within a wider context, one which will test the extent to which these ideas have actually been enacted within contemporary organizations. This follows Thompson (2003) and his disconnected capitalism thesis (DCT) which sought to explore the ways employers struggle and often fail to sustain the &#x2018;high-performance&#x2019; bargains outlined here.</p>

<ul class="BList1">
<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> Three issues have emerged as being of central importance to HRM practitioners, their representative organizations, and academics. These pertain to the ideas of human capital, talent management, and employee engagement.</li>
<li><a id="page_12"></a><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> Human capital ideas see an organization&#x2019;s &#x2018;human&#x2019; resource as being a key means of leveraging the innovation needed for companies to survive. Human capital management is concerned with the value of employees (with some employees being more valuable than others) and how this can be measured.</li>
<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> Talent management activities are designed to secure much-needed skilled and knowledgeable employees in order to meet the organization&#x2019;s current and future business needs.</li>
<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> Finally, employee engagement is perceived by many stakeholders, such as government, professional bodies, and academics, as being as a workplace approach designed to ensure that employees are committed to their organization&#x2019;s goals and values, motivated to contribute to organizational success, and at the same time are able to enhance their own sense of well-being.</li>
<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> It is argued here that these ideas are synergistic and interconnected with roots in high-performance models of HRM and the desire to unlock the discretionary efforts of employees. However, the extent to which these ideas are applied to <i>all</i> segments of an organization&#x2019;s workforce is debateable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">The work of Storey and Guest provides an insight into the components of high-commitment HRM. Huselid&#x2019;s (1995) piece is a frequently cited account of high-performance work practices and firm performance. The CIPD&#x2019;s factsheets on human capital, employee engagement, and talent management are a useful and accessible introduction to these ideas. Coats (2010) provides a highly readable critique of the extent to which these ideas and practices have been adopted in the UK.</p>
<p class="H1_Level1"><a id="ch1h1_5">1.5 Employment restructuring and the changing&#x00A0;nature of work</a></p>
<p class="Text">The UK, alongside other economies, has seen a far-reaching industrial restructuring, prompted by changes in the domestic political landscape and significant developments occurring in the external business environment. This section places the contemporary approaches towards HRM outlined previously against these developments in order to help assess the extent to which the &#x2018;promise&#x2019; of HRM has and can be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_5_1"><span class="greentxt">1.5.1</span> The challenges facing contemporary organizations</p>
<p class="Text">The onset of market and political turbulence experienced in the 1970s saw all Western states experiencing problems with labour productivity as well as unsuccessful economic management (Gamble 1988: 3). Developments such as globalization and the greater integration of Eastern European economies through the auspices of the European Union, the formation of international trading arrangements, and the growth of the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) continue to confront British companies with significant challenges as well as opportunities for expansion. These involve the need to charge competitive rates for goods and services, whilst simultaneously improving their quality and innovative appeal in the search for new markets and profitability.</p>
<p class="TextInd">This drive for competitiveness has been accompanied by three developments which will be outlined here. First, the increased growth and sophistication of computerized technologies, the rise of knowledge work, and the demand for knowledge workers; secondly, the move away from standard forms of working hours and terms and conditions of employment and a shift towards the implementation of part-time and temporary work, fixed term contracts, and so on; thirdly, the shift towards the &#x2018;financialization&#x2019; of many developed economies. The term &#x2018;financialization&#x2019; refers to a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes and elevate the significance of the financial sector relative to others. The development of financialization is associated with downsizing and delayering as firms seek ways of cutting costs to improve financial performance. As a result of these changes&#x2014;as well as the experience of three economic downturns&#x2014;there has been a marked increase in labour market insecurity (Sennett 1998; Burchell et&#x00A0;al. 1999). Taken as a whole, it is pertinent to ask whether organizational competitiveness and allied improvements to the state of the British economy have been achieved at some considerable cost to employees, and to question the role of the HR function in these developments.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_5_2"><a id="page_13"></a><span class="greentxt">1.5.2</span> New technologies and the rise of the knowledge worker</p>
<p class="Text">Whilst many of the changes at work involved with the increased use of networks and technologies are very obvious, and are witnessed in routine daily activities, others, like the demand for sophisticated computer skills, higher-level mathematics, and science abilities within the UK&#x2019;s expanding creative industries, are less obvious but are still urgently needed (CBI 2011<i>b</i>). Securing competitive advantage is also argued to require the diffusion of complex knowledge and capabilities within organizations. In order to capture and diffuse knowledge across a potentially global business, firms have responded to the idea of competing through the creation of knowledge capture and management programmes designed to preserve the asset value of their own employees&#x2019; expertise, whilst simultaneously dispersing it throughout the company via the use of intranets or other methods. Thus highlights the need for employees to be able to engage with technologically mediated processes and have relevant skills.</p>
<p class="TextInd">The focus on competition via skills and knowledge has seen continued growth in occupational groups such as managers, professionals, personal service, and customer services. In the EU, almost 40 per cent of the workforce is already employed in higher-level jobs such as management or professional work, with this proportion expected to growth further. As will be outlined in Chapter 6, the main growth in job numbers is expected to be in posts requiring medium and high-level qualifications, and jobs requiring low or no levels of qualifications will steadily reduce (CBI 2009; <span>UKCES 2009; CEDEFOP 2010). This suggests that whilst creative or high-level jobs are being created</span> by new technology or by the application of highly specialized or creative skills and knowledge, some jobs are continuing to be downgraded. For many, the increased use of ICT has coincided with the growth of the services sector, particularly in relation to financial services such as banking and insurance, and the growth of call centres.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Growth in this sector has been underpinned by the creation of jobs that are difficult to define as &#x2018;knowledge work&#x2019; but depend on a &#x2018;virtually&#x2019; structured IT-mediated organization&#x2013;customer <span>interface where interaction often depends on structured and scripted interactions. These interac</span>tions often require &#x2018;emotional labour&#x2019; (Hochschild 1983; Fineman 1993, 1997) to support the &#x2018;virtual&#x2019; interaction with the customer, sustain the smooth flow of service delivery, and ensure customer satisfaction with the interaction as well as the end product. Here, emphasis is placed on the personality of the individual and the extent to which their values and emotions fit the requirements of the job.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Apart from call centre work, in industries such as hospitality and airline travel greater emphasis is placed on the appearance, dress sense, body shape, and manner of the individual employee, with the increased importance of emotional and aesthetic labour contributing to the shifting definition of skill (Tyler and Abbot 1998; Bach 2005<i>a</i>). However, within organizations, this kind of emotional labour is often deployed to sustain team cohesion, inter-team competitiveness, and organizational identity&#x2014;often with the aim of instigating discretionary effort and reducing staff turnover.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_5_3"><span class="greentxt">1.5.3</span> Challenges to the knowledge economy</p>
<p class="Text">Whilst the ideas outlined above concerning the knowledge economy are widely circulated by a range of government and organizational bodies, and will be explored in more detail in Chapter 6, an alternative argument exists. This suggests that such a high-skills/high-wage strategy for the UK economy is unlikely, given the historically low levels of company investment in research and development as well as in training. Indeed, a low-skill strategy is arguably more important and more likely in many sectors (Boxall et&#x00A0;al. 2007) and is often accompanied by what are termed &#x2018;low-road&#x2019; HRM choices&#x2014;ones that treat employees as a variable input and a cost to be minimized, and are often associated with low-cost business strategies and labour-intensive industries that are not conducive to the high-commitment HRM ideas and practices outlined by Legge (1995). The spread of low-cost competition across the service sector has ramifications for industries which were once relatively protected from competition, and served as sources of relatively high-wage jobs, because they are increasingly subject to tough low-cost competition. If this argument is correct, by implication the relevance of high-performance HRM might soon be confined to a relatively small segment in developed economies such as capital intensive manufacturing and services that are protected from low-cost competition&#x2014;for example, where there is a high degree of regulation or there are monopolies which are not subject to international competition.</p>
<p class="TextInd"><a id="page_14"></a>However, it is argued that, even for organizations which want to compete on the basis of low costs without sacrificing quality, investment in HRM is crucial (Gittell and Bamber 2010) and that the most successful low-cost competitors in the service sector, such as manufacturing, are likely to be those organizations that find ways to achieve the quality standards now demanded by customers whilst also achieving low costs. That is, successful low-cost competition now requires companies to meet quality <i>and</i> productivity goals simultaneously. A frequently cited example of this can be seen in low-cost Southwest Airlines whose adoption of high-road pluralistic HRM practices has been accompanied by shareholder profitability. However, it is useful to compare this example with that of Ryanair, whose HR strategy is diametrically opposed to that of Southwest Airlines, where the company become even more profitable than its American counterpart. They have adopted a low-road model which pays little attention to HRM concepts or practices. Rather than focusing on generating and sustaining employee commitment, their approach relies more on worker control and replacing those who depart through burnout (Wallace et&#x00A0;al. 2007). But whilst the impact of low-road practices on employees are argued by to be damaging to workers, it is instructive to note that organizations such as Ryanair have their proponents, which suggests that commitment models of HRM with their attendant practices are not necessarily viewed as a requirement by shareholders and wider industry commentators.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_5_4"><span class="greentxt">1.5.4</span> The rise of non-standard working and the growth of flexibility</p>
<p class="Text">Another development which continues to run alongside the discourses of knowledge management and the implications of networked computerized technologies is the rise of non-standard working and the growth of flexibility. Surveys and other evidence point to ongoing changes to working time and the contractual bases of employment (Cully et&#x00A0;al. 1999; Kersely et&#x00A0;al. 2006), with the implications of these developments profoundly affecting the employment relationship. In order to understand the implications of these changes, alterations to working time need to be presented next to previous working-time patterns and their regulation.</p>
<p class="TextInd">The work of Beynon et&#x00A0;al. (2002) provides helpful illustrations of the changes that have occurred over time. Where their case study companies were concerned, a pattern of regulated working time seemed to be the norm and was based around notions of standard working hours, premium payments for unsocial hours, and in most cases voluntary rather than scheduled extra and unsocial hours working. However, the strength of regulation and the extent to which overtime and unsocial working hours were voluntary varied between the organizations, with trade union presence being an important factor.</p>
<p class="TextInd"><span>Whilst some of their initial starting points differed, all case organizations experienced significant</span> working time change over the five-year period of their investigations. These were seen in three areas: longer opening or operating hours; the rescheduling of work to increase productive hours and to decrease the use of overtime; and the reduction in the distinctions between standard and unsocial hours or standard and extra hours. However, it is important to note that the use of mechanisms such as annual hours contracts, the growth of self-employment, and fixed-term contracts has actually been very limited; and that even the growth of part-time working has been gradual, and evolved over an extended time period.</p>
<p class="TextInd">It is also important to note that, whilst emphasis has been placed on the erosion of established norms as a means of delivering greater flexibility and greater worker intensification, later evidence paints a somewhat different picture. For example, Kersley et&#x00A0;al. (2006: 92) found that where multi-skilling and functional flexibility were concerned, fewer workplaces were training substantial proportions of their core employees in this way, and that such a trend had been declining over the past decade. Where multi-skilling and job rotation were more prevalent was in production work and financial services, especially where the workplace produced multiple services or goods. Finally, as issues of work&#x2013;life integration increasingly come to the fore, debate is shifting and is more concerned with seeing how temporal flexibility can best be used to suit the employee and their circumstances.</p>
<p class="H2_Level2" id="ch1h2_5_5"><a id="page_15"></a><span class="greentxt">1.5.5</span> Organizational restructuring</p>
<p class="Text">One of the ways in which organizations seek to improve profitability is through changing company structures and reducing staff. The shift towards financialization means that the focus of investment activities changes from investing <i>in</i> productive enterprises (and by implication an ongoing investment in productive employees) to that of extracting money <i>from</i> companies for investment in other domains which yield higher returns. This is particularly true of larger companies who are players in financialized practices via involvement in trading in financial markets or through involvement in successive waves of mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers. This trend has been associated with downsizing (cutting staff numbers) and delayering (removing whole tiers of management or supervisory roles).</p>
<p class="TextInd">Many companies have rationalized, and continue to rationalize, their businesses through tools such as business process re-engineering (Hammer and Champy 1993) or by importing new manufacturing methods such as lean manufacturing (Womack, Jones, and Roos 1990). This has often been accompanied by the kinds of changes to employee terms and conditions of employment described previously as well as by work intensification. For those who became committed to such strategies, the impact on workplace performance and morale was often poor, as illustrated in <a href="#box1_9">Box 1.9</a>.</p>
<p class="TextInd">As noted by McGovern et&#x00A0;al. (2007), worker insecurity is an outcome of perpetual restructuring and downsizing, but it does not necessarily equate with poor worker performance as there is evidence that employees exert high levels of effort in insecure conditions. As noted in the study of Avatar&#x2014;an Irish company heralded as &#x2018;a great place to work&#x2019; (Cushen and Thompson 2011)&#x2014;workers demonstrated very low levels of commitment to the organization as well as hostility to the HR department. However, this did not result in inefficient or poor performance outcomes, but it is uncertain whether this maintenance of performance was due to the employees&#x2019; professionalism or to compliance with market discipline. This case (and others like it) raises a pertinent question as to whether high performance only results from high commitment or &#x2018;enlightened HRM&#x2019; and whether there are other less fortuitous circumstances in which such outcomes might also be witnessed.</p>
<p class="TextInd">It is also important to note that the developments outlined here have not been restricted to the private sector. Tight budgetary controls, new measurements of &#x2018;output&#x2019;, and the generalized introduction of what has been termed &#x2018;the new public management&#x2019; (Dunleavy and Hood 1994) have radically changed many public sector organizations. Consequently, the public&#x2013;private sector divide has become blurred, and the ways in which people are managed has involved the increased use of flexible employment contracts, reduced opportunities for collective voice among workers, and a potential decline in the public service ethos (Corby and White 1999: 15&#x2013;20). However, privatization did not occur across the whole of the public sector and, even now, 23 per cent of UK employees still work in the public sector (Rogers 2011). But public sector employees continue to see their jobs and conditions of work subject to radical change, especially with regard to increases in workload and centrally imposed targets for service delivery. The economic downturn has also witnessed the occurrence of further changes to the public sector in both the UK and other EU economies, with large-scale redundancies and the further outsourcing of activities to the private and third sectors still being planned.</p>

<p class="Text">Over the past couple of decades, employee downsizing has become an integral part of organizational life. Global competitive pressures have caused firms to critically examine their cost structures, including those associated with human resources. Once confined primarily to the USA, employee downsizing has, over time, become the norm in many countries. The magnitude of the downsizing activity has been exacerbated by the current recession. The extent of job losses has been staggering (Datta et&#x00A0;al. 2010). In the USA alone, more than 6.5 million jobs have been &#x2018;downsized&#x2019; since the economic downturn began in December 2007, with the numbers expected to grow in the foreseeable future. Research concerning the serial use of downsizing found that repeated downsizing led to repeatedly negative consequences in terms of employee satisfaction, workplace conflict, and workplace performance. The organizations sampled over a five-year period in New Zealand did not seem able to shake off the trauma of repeated downsizing, leading the authors to speculate that those serial downsizing organizations were not adjusting future practices to reflect past experiences. Rather than seeing a form of organizational learning taking place, they seemed to witness simple instrumental responses to poor financial performance with a negative impact being an outcome of this strategy (Gilson, Hurd, and Wagar 2004).</p>
</div>
<p class="TextInd"><a id="page_16"></a>Finally, these developments, as well as the shift towards financialization, mean that even organizations that develop track records of high performance, creativity, and commitment are finding it harder to sustain the kinds of stable conditions that are needed for high-performance HRM practices (P. Thompson 2011). And if varieties of market discipline can operate as a means of driving performance, to what extent are high-commitment practices&#x2014;or even HRM itself&#x2014;required? However, as noted by Godard (2004: 371), it might make good sense for employers to adopt what have traditionally been seen to be good management practices with some alternative work practices grafted onto them. These may not yield the high levels of commitment and discretionary effort promised by the high-performance approach to HRM, but they might be expected to yield reasonable levels of consent and realistic levels of performance.</p>

<ul class="BList1">
<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> Organizations have responded to changes in their business environments in a number of ways. These have been influenced by developments in IT and its widespread use as well as a swing away from semi-skilled work to managerial and professional jobs.

<li><span class="grdot">&#x2022;</span> Whilst some commentators argue that Britain has survived this period of heightened competition in good shape, there is also evidence of heightened worker insecurity. However, the extent to which this results in poor performance outcomes is not clear.</li>

</ul>
<p class="Text">P. Thompson (2003, 2011) provides critiques of HRM and places these criticisms within broader considerations of the political economy.

<p class="Text">At this juncture it is pertinent to assess the developments occurring in relation to the HR function, considering the impact of HRM philosophies and practices on the practitioner role. Since the advent of HRM, there has been no shortage of advice provided to HR practitioners as to how to gain access to the higher echelons of strategic decision-making. Key here has been the work of David Ulrich who argues that the HRM agenda provides opportunities for the HR function to demonstrate &#x2018;added value&#x2019; through a focus on what HR <i>delivers</i> rather than on what it does (Ulrich 1997; Ulrich and Brockbank 2005). Gaining added value is achieved by the fulfilment of six key roles (Ulrich et&#x00A0;al. 2009: 3&#x2013;4).</p>
<ol class="NLista1">
<li><span class="greentxt">1.&#x0009;Credible activist.</span><span class="SHLN-2"></span> The HR professional is both credible and active, offering a point of view and challenging assumptions.</li>
<li><span class="greentxt">2.&#x0009;Culture and change steward.</span><span class="SHLN-2"></span> The HR professional helps shape a company&#x2019;s culture. They coach managers in how their actions reflect and drive culture, they weave the cultural standards into HR practices and processes, and they help make culture happen via the implementation of relevant activities.</li>
<li><a id="page_17"></a><span class="greentxt">3.&#x0009;Talent manager/organizational designer.</span><span class="SHLN-2"></span> The HR professional ensures that the company&#x2019;s means of talent management and organizational capabilities are aligned with customer requirements and strategy.</li>
<li><span class="greentxt">4.&#x0009;Strategy architect.</span><span class="SHLN-2"></span> The HR professional has a vision of how the organization can compete and thrive, and thus plays an active part in the establishment of the overall strategy. This means recognizing business trends and their impact on the business, forecasting potential obstacles to success, and facilitating the process of gaining strategic clarity.</li>
<li><span class="greentxt">5.&#x0009;Operational executor.</span><span class="SHLN-2"></span> <span>The HR professional executes the operational aspects of managing people and organizations, such as policy formation, HR administration, and other operations&#x2014;often dealt with through technology, shared services, and/or outsourcing.</span></li>
<li><span class="greentxt">6.&#x0009;Business ally.</span><span class="SHLN-2"></span> HR professionals contribute to the success of a business by knowing the setting in which their business operates. They also know who customers are and why they buy the company&#x2019;s products or services, and they have a good understanding of how the parts of the business work together, so that they can help the business organize to ensure profitability.</li>
</ol>
<p class="TextInd5">The strategic architect and business ally roles, and the previous versions of them, have caught the imagination of the organizations representing HR practitioners, such as the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), and they have been highly influential in defining the strategic business-focused skills and attributes required by contemporary successful HR professionals (Gilmore and Williams 2007). However, over time, this has resulted in a decline of interest in or inclusion of any employee advocate role which, in turn, has led to claims that the function has disappeared from the shop floor (Francis and Keegan 2006). Additionally, the willingness to outsource aspects of HR activity is arguably an instance of the function promoting or being faced with its own marginalization, as not all aspects of outsourced HR work are administrative and non-core.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Additionally, the delivery of HRM has to factor in the critical role played by front-line managers (FLMs). As demonstrated by Purcell and Hutchinson (2007: 16), their evaluation of twelve &#x2018;excellent&#x2019; UK companies showed that in order for FLMs to be effective in the people management role, they needed a good range of HR policies and practices to work with, as well as good leadership skills. The findings showed that employees responded positively to both the HR practices <i>and</i> their FLM leadership behaviour. Such findings have interesting implications for the ways in which HRM is conceptualized&#x2014;seeing it as not only being concerned with the coherent integration of mutually reinforcing policies and practices relating to critical features of employee resourcing, but also as being involved with a wider remit that covers leadership behaviour and organizational climate (Purcell and Hutchinson 2007: 4).</p>
<p class="H1_Level1"><a id="ch1h1_7">1.7 Assessing change</a></p>
<p class="Text">What have such radical changes meant for the theories and practices of HRM and for its function? The coming of HRM promised change, but it seems to have been a model, in its more &#x2018;enlightened&#x2019; form, that has struggled to meet the dual demands for economic efficiency and improvements to the quality of jobs and working life that it promoted (Coats 2010). In the end, proponents of HRM seriously underestimated the will and ability of managers to instigate the changes to working practices and organizational structures that they deemed necessary to achieve high-performance outcomes. The UK&#x2019;s business system, with its focus on short-term profitability and the dominance of financial capital, was not conducive to the kinds of practices advocated by proponents of high-road HRM. Intensifying competition also failed to drive firms &#x2018;up market&#x2019; in terms of high-skill/high-wage goods and services, and instead arguably encouraged many firms to operate differently and reduce the costs associated with employment where possible (Bach 2005<i>a</i>).</p>
<p class="TextInd">In part, HRM can be seen as a consequence of operating in new territory with new rules governing the employment relationship, especially in relation to the weakening of trade unionism and the rise of a more managerialist perspective (Beardwell 1996). This process of change shows no signs of abating, and the new work context demands new HRM strategies and practices to meet these challenges, many of which have been caused by the impact of previous &#x2018;innovations&#x2019; and the stresses to working conditions caused by them.</p>
<p class="TextInd"><a id="page_18"></a>For the HR function, the attempt to shift towards a more strategic role floundered, and harsher economic climates jeopardized the implementation of softer commitment-based models. As focus on these approaches has arguably diminished, and the political and economic context altered; HRM as a term is now used more generically rather than as a particular approach to gaining workforce commitment.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Arguably, greater challenges for the HR function are posed by the shifting organizational boundaries and the permeable &#x2018;boundary-less&#x2019; nature of many companies. The variety of ways in which people are employed and the different contractual bases make it hard to sustain organizational identification, and the rise of the networked enterprise creates tensions in the employment relationship, increasing the complexity of managing and monitoring performance as well as making it harder to sustain commitment. The emphasis on the importance of managing the whole personality of the employee&#x2014;as witnessed in examples of emotional labour&#x2014;broadens the scope of HR practice and inevitably spills over into considerations of ethics as well as the boundaries between work and life outside it. More importantly, the emphasis on this form of labour draws attention to the psychological injuries of work and broadens the scope of the HR remit to address issues of bullying, violence, and stress at work (Bach 2005<i>a</i>).</p>
<p class="H1_Level1"><a id="ch1h1_8">1.8 Conclusion</a></p>
<p class="Text">The arrival of HRM coincided with a period of economic restructuring experienced by many Western economies. But whilst HRM was temporarily identified with a given governmental and organizational &#x2018;project&#x2019; designed to improve business and economic performance, the term is no longer tied to a particular orientation towards people management, managerial philosophy, or style. However, certain ideas still remain influential&#x2014;if still the object of debate and dispute&#x2014;and revolve around the performance advantages that are stated to accrue to those organizations who secure alignment between the organization&#x2019;s strategic goals and its HR policies and practices. The promotion of this relationship has allowed those responsible for people management to argue for an increased involvement in the strategic decision-making of the organization, with a consequent enhancement of the HR function. The influential work of authors such as David Ulrich has also provided the HR function with a means by which that leverage might be achieved through the development of core HR&#x00A0;roles.&#x00A0;But, whilst Ulrich&#x2019;s work remains influential, the strategic role he envisaged for HR is still elusive.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Although the debates concerning HRM occurred at a highly propitious time for the function, the devolution of much HR activity to line managers meant that the clear-cut link between HR practices and organizational performance was less evident; obscured as it was by the involvement of a third party. In addition, organizational responses to competitive pressures have not necessarily involved companies taking the &#x2018;high road&#x2019; in terms of people management practices. Instead of a longer-term investment in worker skills coupled with the provision of more sophisticated managerial styles and abilities, many UK companies adopted a more familiar &#x2018;low-road&#x2019; approach, reducing costs through the increased use of IT systems, the deployment of flexible approaches towards employment, and reductions in headcount.</p>
<p class="TextInd">The process of change shows no sign of abating, and the HR function, together with line managers, needs to develop effective strategies for meeting future challenges. As work continues to be contingent for many, HRM is faced with the enduring challenge of fostering and maintaining commitment to an organization and its goals in an environment where employees might have multiple employers and be employed on a variety of contractual bases. Seeking employee engagement has now gone beyond the ideas of commitment and has been subsumed by an approach that seeks to secure a fit between the values and personality of the employee and the employer &#x2018;brand&#x2019;. But such emotional engagement and labour is being challenged by increased calls for a more effective work&#x2013;life balance, with HR being required to consider the employee in more holistic ways that spill over the traditional boundaries between work and home.</p>

<p class="Text">One of the continuing success stories in UK elite sport is that of the GB Cycling Team (Team GB) who have dominated the road, track, BMX, and MTB disciplines at the World Championships and Olympics over the last decade. Much of the success has been attributed to the work of Dave Brailsford, the Team&#x2019;s Performance Director, and his exceptional &#x2018;backroom&#x2019; staff who support and enhance the work of the cyclists across a range of functions such as bike technology, psychology, and race preparation.</p>
<p class="TextInd">Team Sky was formed in 2009 (<a href="http://www.teamsky.com">www.teamsky.com</a>). Whereas the cycling remit and focus of the Team GB is broadly focused on a range of cycling events, Team Sky focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on competing in the many road races and tournaments taking place on a global basis each year. The most prestigious and best known of these is the Tour de France (TDF). One of the headline aims of Team Sky was to win this coveted road race within five years and to do so with a hub of British cyclists, although the squad of 25 cyclists is highly international. The finances at the disposal of Team Sky also augured well for the fledgling team as they are backed by satellite broadcaster BSkyB via &#x00A3;30 million in sponsorship with the organization until 2013.</p>
<p class="TextInd"><a id="page_20"></a>However, the formation of Team Sky caused a degree of controversy (Fotheringham 2012). This was due to the employment of Dave Brailsford, who joined the organization&#x2019;s management as Team Principal along with other Team GB staff members such as Head Coach Shane Sutton, Psychiatrist Steve Peters, and Race Coach Rod Ellingworth, with most of these Team Sky personnel still retaining their positions within the Team GB. However, this dual membership and allied experience is fundamental to Team Sky in that they seek to replicate the successful operation founded by the Team GB staff within a road racing context. The relationship between the professional cyclists and their track management team took a while to bed down, with the British Cycling staff having to get used to the demands made by corporate sponsors&#x2014;who desire a constant flow of success, as opposed to the more sporadic calendar of events and expectations witnessed in track cycling&#x2014;and a voracious and sometimes intrusive media. Additions were made to the backroom staff, requiring additional work from Brailsford and Peters to ensure that this team was cohesive. Nonetheless, sharp criticisms were made that the track team was affected by Peters&#x2019; dual role (McRae 2011).</p>
<p class="TextInd">Whilst the 2010 season saw a shaky start for the new team, 2011 saw them enjoy good performances in the Tour Down Unde and the Tours of Qatar and Oman. In the &#x2018;classics&#x2019; season, successes were achieved by Bradley Wiggins and Geraint Thomas, but it was the signing of World Champion and TDF Green Jersey winner, Mark Cavendish, that caught the majority of media attention (Fotheringham 2011), as was the Team&#x2019;s success in the Paris&#x2013;Nice race in 2012, when the cycling season starts to get serious. In July 2012, and going with form, Bradley Wiggins won the TDF with team mate, Chris Froome, coming second. The final race of the Tour saw Wiggins lead out Team Sky to secure the Champs Elys<span>&#x00E9;</span>e stage win for Cavendish. Just over two years into their life as a racing entity, Sky are not merely part of the furniture but one of the strongest squads in the sport.</p>

<ol class="NList">
<li><span class="graytxt">1&#x0009;</span>Although this case is not directly concerned with HRM, what ideas does it prompt as to the links that <i>might</i> exist between some of the HR practices mentioned in this chapter and organizational performance?</li>
<li><span class="graytxt">2&#x0009;</span>As with many elite sports, there is rarely an HR function tasked with the kinds of activities outlined in this chapter. If you were the newly appointed head of HR at Team Sky, how would you seek to show the value of the function?</li>
<li><span class="graytxt">3&#x0009;</span>Team Sky&#x2019;s success seems to depend on attracting and retaining highly experienced and qualified members of staff as well as internationally renowned cyclists. What kinds of HR practices would need to be in place to bring such staff to a <i>less</i> prestigious sports organization?</li>
<li><span class="graytxt">4&#x0009;</span>How would you suggest that an organization like Team Sky captures, retains, and shares the knowledge and experience possessed by its backroom staff so that they can withstand the loss of valued employees to other teams?</li>
