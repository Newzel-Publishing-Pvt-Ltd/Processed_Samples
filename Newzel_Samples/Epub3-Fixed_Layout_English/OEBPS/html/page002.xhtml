<p class="page002_1">From &#x2013;273.15C&#x00B0; to as hot as it can ever get, in 4 pages</p>
<p class="page002_3">Check out these amazing numbers (not quite to scale, obviously!)</p>
<p class="page002_4">&#x2013;273.15&#x00B0;C</p>
<p class="page002_5">Absolute zero. The coldest possible temperature at which atoms theoretically stop moving. Pack accordingly. Scientists also call this temperature 0 degrees kelvin (K) and kelvin units go up at the same rate as Celsius. As you ll see on page 10, we ve come incredibly close to this temperature in the lab.</p>
<p class="page002_6">&#x2013;40&#x00B0;C/F</p>
<p class="page002_7">The point at which the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales intersect.</p>
<p class="page002_8">&#x2013;273&#x00B0;C</p>
<p class="page002_9">The lowest temperature survived by a living creature &#x2013; the tardigrade. Check out pages 118 119 for more about these amazingly rugged little invertebrates.</p>
<p class="page002_10">0&#x00B0;C</p>
<p class="page002_11">The melting point of ice.</p>
<p class="page002_12">&#x2013;183&#x00B0;C</p>
<p class="page002_13">The boiling point of oxygen. Below this, oxygen is in liquid form. Liquid oxygen is used for everything from medical devices to treating waste water to launching rocket ships. At &#x2013;219 C liquid oxygen freezes.</p>
<p class="page002_14">Perfectly six</p>
<p class="page002_15">6</p>
<p class="page002_16">The <span class="white">6th</span> day of the year is <span class="white">January 6</span></p>
<p class="page002_17">Take the divisors of 6 apart from 6 itself (we call these the &#x2018;aliquot&#x2019; divisors or &#x2018;proper&#x2019; factors) and add them together. You get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. It doesn&#x2019;t happen very often that the sum of the aliquot divisors of a number add up to the number. The Greeks christened them &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; numbers and 6 is the smallest perfect number.</p>
<p class="page002_18">There is only 1 other &#x2018;perfect day&#x2019; in a calendar year. Can you guess what it is? Hint: It falls in the month of January.</p>
