<p class="noindent">This document defines the objectives of pre-operative assessment, emphasising the need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support all patients as they prepare themselves for surgery.</li>
<li>Identify important high-risk patients and promote safety.</li>
<li>Reduce the risk to the patient and optimise the patient&#8217;s condition pre-operatively.</li>
<li>Identify and mitigate potential anaesthetic difficulties.</li>
<li>Allay fear, anxiety and lack of understanding through clear explanation, written information and appropriate discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Many patients, however, will not see an anaesthetist before admission as they will have been adequately assessed by skilled practitioners using established protocols. Anaesthetists must therefore ensure that the information provided not only allows for efficiency on the day of admission but also addresses any of the patient&#8217;s concerns previously noted. If these concerns are not adequately dealt with by the practitioner, the patient should have access to a consultation with an anaesthetist before the day of operation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Both assessment before admission and the pre-operative visit allow patients to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss their peri-operative care.</li>
<li>Ask questions and discuss their fears and anxieties, particularly about previous anaesthetic experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Communication must be clear, with consistent messages given to the patient regarding choices for anaesthesia, post-operative analgesia, prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting, pre-operative starvation and any other concerns raised by the patient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_25"/>It is extremely important that adequate explanation is given by anaesthetists and other staff should it become necessary to postpone surgery. In addition to the impact on the patient&#8217;s medical condition, it is likely to cause considerable disruption to both their work and their home life.</p>
<p class="noindent">Information specifically targeted for patients is also available in the patient information section of the Royal College of Anaesthetists website (<a href="http://www.rcoa.ac.uk">http://www.rcoa.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<p class="noindent">The prospect of anaesthesia remains daunting for many people. Given the time constraints of &#8216;same-day&#8217; admission it may be difficult for the patients to receive the level of consultation that would be considered ideal. However, the opportunity to talk to a doctor who fully understands their needs may ensure a more confident and co-operative relationship between the patient and the doctor.</p>
